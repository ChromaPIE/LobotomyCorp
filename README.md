Greetings, Manager. 
I see that you've been slacking off while playing a few rounds of cards during our work hours. 
I am unfamiliar with playing cards myself, but I am able to modify this little game of yours so that you can still have "fun" while still generating precious energy to meet the daily quota. 
This may hinder your playing experience, but I am sure you will do just fine.</i></h5>

# Features
## Abnormalities, as Jokers
Each added Abnormality have different Observation Levels that unlock more of their Information. 
This is based on the amount of rounds played with that Abnormality in your Joker slots.

*Note: The **Unlock All** function will **not** unlock Abnormalities' Information. You have to use Debug Mode's **Unlock** function.* 

## Abnormalities, as Boss Blinds
Some Abnormalities are able to ***breach***. 
In addition, some breaching Abnormalities can guarantee that the next Ante's boss blind is an Abnormality. 
These blinds are very hard to take down, make sure you're well-prepared before tackling on these challenges.

## Extraction Pack
To help with discovering Abnormalities, a new **Booster Pack** type is added. 
This pack allows you to pick one of three Abnormalities to add to your Joker slots.

## Ordeals
During the run, **Ordeals** can replace some blinds. These blinds are generally more difficult to take down compared to the other blinds, 
with **Dawn Ordeals** being the easiest, and **Midnight Ordeals** being much a lot more brutal.

## Challenges
*Note: Challenges are themed around Lobotomy Corporation itself, as such, they may spoil major parts of the game.* 

In some Challenges, Ordeals are guaranteed to appear. In others, you might be fighting **[[[INFORMATION REDACTED]]]**. 
Good luck, Manager. You will need it.
